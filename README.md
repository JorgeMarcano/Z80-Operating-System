# Z80-Operating-System
A Basic Operating System for the Z80 CPU

To build the current OS files, run "compDump.ps1"
Make sure you have "rasm_win64.exe" in the same folder. You can get it in the [Official Repo](https://github.com/EdouardBERGE/rasm). Credits for the Assembler go to EdouardBERGE

The ps1 file will also automatically allow you to upload to an eeprom if you so choose.
